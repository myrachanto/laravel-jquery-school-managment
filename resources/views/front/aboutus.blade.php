       <h1 class="specialh">Chantos E-School</h1>
     <p> Chantos school management web –based application is designed to embrace and tighten an already loose existing relationship between parents, teacher and kids/students. It has often told that parents are no longer involved in their children’s life and to be honest that has come to be a shock even to caring parents.<br />
Its embarrassing really to realize sometimes you have no idea what the stronghold of your kids in terms of subjects, sports and the like. In today’s world, it’s evident that the future of entrepreneurs is quite remarkable despite what they choose to entrepreneur in for example athletic is quite rewarding nowadays, so is football, or song writer or a dancer and the list goes on and on.<br />
This system keeps the parent updated of the student progress in all aspects of his/her study. It’s quite a remarkable system given that it has multiple authorizations namely <br />
<ol><li>	Teacher/principal portal.</li>
<li>	The accountant department/bursars portal.</li>
<li>	The parent/student portal.</li> </ol>
With the teacher panel, it has being designed to operate with user access levels such that the principal has full control of the system while a regular teacher has access to what is deemed fit for his/her use- like he/she cant access the expulsion list.<br />
The beauty and resourcefulness of the system extends to the fact that it comes with a responsive well designed website for the school. Technology that would otherwise cost the institution more money to put in place in the near future and let’s be honest website as marketing tool that is otherwise attracting more attention in this digital world</p>
